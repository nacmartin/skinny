Skinny 
======

Skinny is a simple application to build lists. 
It is coded with [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/).

You can see it online at [http://listandcheck.com](http://listandcheck.com).

Installation
------------

Skinny is a symfony application. You can clone its repository by doing
  
  git clone git://github.com/nacmartin/skinny.git

and then configure your database with:

  vim config/databases.yml

After that, you can proceed as usual with symfony.

Postscript

In case you are curious, Skinny is a character of Breaking Bad (I name projects after BB characters).
